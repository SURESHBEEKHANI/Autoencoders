# Autoencoder Types

This repository contains implementations and examples of different types of autoencoders for various applications.

## Types of Autoencoders

### 1. Vanilla Autoencoder

- **Purpose**: Vanilla autoencoders learn efficient representations of data by compressing it into a latent-space representation and then reconstructing the original input from this representation.
  
- **Architecture**: Typically consists of an encoder network that compresses the input data and a decoder network that reconstructs the input from the latent space representation.
  
- **Usage**: Include instructions on how to train the vanilla autoencoder, example datasets used, and how to evaluate its performance.

### 2. Denoising Autoencoder

- **Purpose**: Denoising autoencoders are trained to remove noise from corrupted input data, thereby learning more robust feature representations.
  
- **Architecture**: Similar to vanilla autoencoders but trained with noisy input and optimized to reconstruct clean data.
  
- **Usage**: Describe how to prepare and use noisy datasets for training, and provide examples of denoising results.

### 3. Convolutional Autoencoder

- **Purpose**: Convolutional autoencoders use convolutional layers for both the encoder and decoder, making them suitable for image data where spatial relationships are important.
  
- **Architecture**: Encoder and decoder networks consist of convolutional and pooling layers, allowing them to learn hierarchical features.
  
- **Usage**: Specify image preprocessing steps, training details, and demonstrate reconstruction quality with image examples.

### 4. Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

- **Purpose**: Variational autoencoders learn a latent-space representation that follows a probabilistic distribution, enabling generation of new data points.
  
- **Architecture**: Includes an encoder that learns the parameters of the latent distribution and a decoder that generates data points from sampled latent variables.
  
- **Usage**: Discuss the use of latent variables for generating new data, training VAEs with variational lower bounds, and provide examples of generated outputs.
